# PoCaS(Potsdam-Catalogue-Scripts)-ULX

This is a repository containing many of the scripts used to build the
XMM-Newton ULX-based catalogue published in Bernadich et al., 2021, A&A, in
preparation; which is available at the CDS, and the catalogues from the master
thesis by Miquel Colom i Bernadich, submitted in Uppsala University in
2021. Many of these scripts require an installation of STILTS (http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/) to run.

It also contains many other scripts that were written alongside, such as
correction tools and plotting scripts.

```pointlikelybuilder.sh```, ```ULXscriptCompilation.sh``` and scripts within,
and ```ULX_XMM_HECATE_GaiaAGN.sh``` were used to create
the catalogue from Bernadich et al., 2021, A&A, in preparation.

```analyze_XMM.sh``` produced some of the plots published in Bernadich et al., 2021, A&A, in preparation.

```imageV.py``` and ```imageX.py``` were used to downolar PanSTARRS-1 and
XMM-Newton images. ```fc_tool.py```, writen by Jan Kurpas, was used to plot
those images into .png format.
